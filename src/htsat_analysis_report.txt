INTERPRETATION
==============
The analysis reveals a hierarchical organization of attention heads in HTSAT,
with distinct functional specialization patterns emerging across layers. 
Higher layers show enhanced discriminative capacity, while specialization
varies across the network. The identification of 8 functional clusters suggests
modular processing of audio features, with implications for model interpretability
and potential pruning strategies.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLICATION
================================
1. Use figures 1, 4, and 6 as main text figures
2. Include figures 2, 3, 5 as supplementary materials
3. Report statistical tests with proper corrections
4. Discuss layer-wise progression in relation to audio processing hierarchy
5. Compare findings with vision transformers (ViT) literature
